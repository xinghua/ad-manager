# How to write patterns:
# Commonly, the patterns are regex.
# Provided some source directory like this:
# <top_dir>/
#         .svn/
#          app/
#              .svn/
#              script.py
#              script.pyc
#          test/
#              .svn/
#              a.py
#              b.py
#              b.py
#          todo.txt
#
# 1. Exclude a certain directory, including the files in its.
#   Use the directory name as pattern
#   eg: exclude directory `test', the pattern is "test"
# 2. Exclude all file with specified suffix
#   Use the suffix as pattern
#   eg: exclude file with suffix .pyc, the pattern is "*.pyc"
# 3. Exclude a certain file
#   Use the file name as pattern
#   eg: exclude file `todo.txt', the pattern is "todo.txt"


# Exclude pattern list, one pattern per line
# Lines with leading sharp are comments, will be ignored.
